## About
This post lists some tips and tricks that I've learned about Vim.

## Details
### Case insensitive search
If you put '\c' anywhere in a search expression, it becomes case
insensitive:
{% highlight vim %}
/foo\c
{% endhighlight %}

### Marks
Marks are useful to jump back and forth between different locations in a file.

{% highlight vim %}
m{a-zA-Z}  "set mark
`{a-zA-Z}  "go to mark
'{a-zA-Z}  "go to mark
:marks     "view set marks
{% endhighlight %}
